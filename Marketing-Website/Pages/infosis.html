    <h1>Controversies</h1>
    <p>Accusation of visa fraud in the USA
In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[67] it along with another similar case,[68][69][70] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities – and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[71]
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[72] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[73] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[74]
Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney
In 2015, the United States Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.
