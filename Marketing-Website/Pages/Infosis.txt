CEOs
Since its establishment in 1981 till 2014, the CEOs of Infosys were its promoters, with N.R. Narayana Murthy leading the company in its initial 21 years. Dr Vishal Sikka was the first non-promoter CEO of Infosys who worked for around 3 years.[47][48][49] Dr Vishal Sikka resigned in August 2017. In a personal note to board colleagues,[50] Sikka cites a "drumbeat of distractions" and "false, baseless, malicious and increasingly personal attacks" as his reason for leaving Infosys.[51] Many sources suspect this is in reference to a long running feud with Infosys Founders over the new direction Sikka was reportedly taking Infosys.[52][53][54] After his resignation, UB Pravin Rao was appointed as Interim CEO and MD of Infosys.[55] Infosys appointed Salil Parekh chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) of the company with effect from January 2, 2018,[1].[56]

Controversies
Accusation of visa fraud in the USA

In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,[67] it along with another similar case,[68][69][70] brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities – and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started investigating.[71]

In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.[72] Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of 'prolonged litigation'.[73] In its statement the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[74]

Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney

In 2015, the United States Department of Labor began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at Disney and Southern California Edison. The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.
